 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Lieh-mon's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
    My coding journey began relatively late‚ÄîI embarked on this exciting path right after high school.

üöÄ Despite starting later than some, I'm determined to make the most of every opportunity to grow and excel in the world of coding. Admittedly, it hasn't always been easy. As a self-proclaimed slow learner, I faced challenges in grasping certain concepts and struggled with some mathematical aspects of programming. However, my unwavering dedication has allowed me to overcome these obstacles and continue my journey of learning and improvement.

üí° My biggest goal behind loving to become a developer is to build web apps for my people. I aim to create platforms that cater to the needs and aspirations of the local community. Additionally, I have a vision of creating a local site akin to Netflix, showcasing native movies and promoting the rich culture and talent of my people. Achieving this dream is no small feat; it's a challenge that fuels my determination. It's easy to say, but the journey to bring it to life requires dedication, innovation, and relentless effort. Yet, it's precisely this challenge that makes the goal all the more exhilarating. By transforming this vision into reality, I strive to captivate and empower individuals, bridging the gap between technology and our community's aspirations. Together, let's embark on this exciting adventure, turning words into action, and opening doors to a world of endless possibilities.

üé® I believe that being a self-taught developer brings its own unique perspective to the table. It fuels my creativity and drive to build projects from scratch, designing innovative solutions to real-world challenges.

üåü Join me as I traverse this inspiring journey, embracing the wonders of coding and shaping the digital landscape. Together, let's push boundaries, overcome obstacles, and celebrate the triumphs of being an indie full-stack developer from a non-science background. I may have started late and faced some difficulties, but I'm determined to keep learning and growing."
